## Graduate Research Projects ##

**Research Rotations at Emory University** : Aug. 2021 - present
* As a first year Ph.D. student, I am currently doing 10-week long rotations in 3 different labs.
* Research project descriptions from each rotation will be added below upon completion.

**Read Lab Rotation** : Sept. 2021 - Nov. 2021 
* My rotation project was to identify IMP3 candidate target transcripts maintaining the cancer stem cell state in Glioblastoma (GBM).        
* During this rotation I performed the following techniques:
  * Monitor RCAS-TVA mouse model for GBM and perform brain dissections 
  * Culture primary neurospheres with aseptic tissue culture techniques
  * Screen preliminary high throughput RNA-Seq data to identify candidate target transcripts
  * Perform western blots and qPCR to assess selected candidate target transcripts
  * Design and conduct RNA immunoprecipitations to validate transcripts as direct targets of IMP3

## Undergraduate Research Projects ##

**Research Assistant at Grimsey Lab** : Sept. 2018 - April 2021 
* My project was to develop & characterize a subcellular targeted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor platform to assess the spatiotemporal activation of atypical p38 signaling.
* These FRET biosensors enabled real-time detection of p38 kinase activity at specific organelles by measuring changes in fluorescence ratios.
* Each FRET biosensor consisted of a...
  * Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) 
  * Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
  * Linker peptide that changes conformation upon phosphorylation by p38
  * Nuclear, plasma membrane, or diffuse/cytosolic targeting motifs
