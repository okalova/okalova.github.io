## Research Experience ##

**Research Rotations at Emory University** : Aug. 2021 - present
* As a first year Ph.D. student, I am currently doing 10-week long rotations in 3 different labs.
* Research experiences from each rotation will be added below upon completion.


**Research Assistant at Grimsey Lab** : Sept. 2018 - April 2021 
* My project was to develop & characterize a subcellular targeted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor platform to assess the spatiotemporal activation of atypical p38 signaling.
* These FRET biosensors enabled real-time detection of p38 kinase activity at specific organelles by measuring changes in fluorescence ratios.
* Each FRET biosensor consisted of a...
  * Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) 
  * Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
  * Linker peptide that changes conformation upon phosphorylation by p38
  * Nuclear, plasma membrane, or diffuse/cytosolic targeting motifs
