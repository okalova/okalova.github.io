## Research Experience ##

* **Research Rotations at Emory University** : Aug. 2021 - present
  * As a first year Ph.D. student, I am currently doing 10-week long rotations in 3 different labs.
  * Research experiences from each rotation will be added below upon completion.



* **Research Assistant at Grimsey Lab** : Sept. 2018 - April 2021 
As a research assistant in the Grimsey Lab, I helped develop a subcellular targeted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor platform to assess the spatiotemporal activation of atypical p38 signaling. 

ðŸ”¬Each FRET biosensor consisted of aâ€¦
  * Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) 
  * Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
  * Linker peptide that changes conformation upon phosphorylation by p38
  * Nuclear, plasma membrane, or diffuse/cytosolic targeting motifs

These FRET biosensors enabled real-time detection of p38 kinase activity at specific organelles by measuring changes in fluorescence ratios. When in close proximity, CFP will donate energy to YFP, changing the mean fluorescent from 485 to 527 nm. After developing the FRET biosensors, I then worked to characterize specific variances in spatiotemporal GPCR dependent activation of p38.
