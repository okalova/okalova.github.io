## Graduate Research Projects ##




## Emory 10 Week Long PhD Research ##

**Hepler Lab Rotation** : Nov. 2021 - Feb. 2021 
* My rotation project was to the development of high-throughput screening assays for small molecule inhibitors of the RGS14:GÎ±i1-GDP signaling complex.        

**Read Lab Rotation** : Sept. 2021 - Nov. 2021 
* My rotation project was to identify IMP3 candidate target transcripts maintaining the cancer stem cell state in Glioblastoma (GBM).        

## Undergraduate Research ##

**Research Assistant at Grimsey Lab** : Sept. 2018 - April 2021 
* My project was to develop & characterize a subcellular targeted fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor platform to assess the spatiotemporal activation of atypical p38 signaling.
* These FRET biosensors enabled real-time detection of p38 kinase activity at specific organelles by measuring changes in fluorescence ratios.
* Each FRET biosensor consisted of a...
  * Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) 
  * Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
  * Linker peptide that changes conformation upon phosphorylation by p38
  * Nuclear, plasma membrane, or diffuse/cytosolic targeting motifs
