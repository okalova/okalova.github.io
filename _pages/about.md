## 👩🏻‍🔬 Hi there, my name is Jennifer. ##

* 🧬 I am a Ph.D. student studying Molecular & Systems Pharmacology at Emory University.
* 🔬 My background is in Pharmaceutical Science and during my studies and research I have worked on many projects using a variety of techniques.
* 🧫 I’m interested in finding therapeutic targets for drug development by investigating the cell signaling in disease states.
* 🧪 By researching pathological cellular mechanisms I ultimately hope to help take a drug from the bench top to the bed of a patient.
