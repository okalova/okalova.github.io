A data-driven personal website
====== 
I am a Pharmaceutical Scientist and Ph.D. student for Molecular & Systems Pharmacology at Emory University. I am passionate about drug development and searching for new therapeutic targets through investigations of pathological cell signaling / mechanisms. During my studies and research, I have worked on many projects combining confocal microscopy, tissue culture, molecular cloning, immunoblotting, computational analysis and many other techniques of research.
