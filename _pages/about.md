## Hi there, my name is Jennifer I am a Pharmacology Ph.D. Student at Emory University . ##

* ðŸ§¬ I am conducting research in the Spencer Lab at the AFLAC Pediatric Cancer & Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. 
* ðŸ”¬ At the Spencer Lab I am studying hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy for Hemophilia A as well as Sickle Cell Disease.
* ðŸ§« I am specifically interested in developing nongenotoxic conditioning regimens to prepare patients for bone marrow transplants.
* ðŸ§ª By studying gene therapy, I ultimately hope to help take a cure from the bench top to the bed of a patient.
